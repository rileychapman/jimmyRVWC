This is a repository for robtics research at Olin College of Engineering. More specifically, this is where some of Jimmy's code will be. 

To search for available servos run the command (change the usb port as necesarry): 
python lib_robotis.py -d /dev/ttyUSB0 --scan

On a mac, Doc's USB2Dynamixel could be scanned using 
python lib_robotis.py -d /dev/tty.usbserial-AH01FOVT  --scan
